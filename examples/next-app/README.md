# Nextjs x Dinoco

This is a Next.js project which uses Dinoco for managing routing in the dynamic pages. You can see the [...segments].tsx file in the app directory which is used for dynamic routing.

We have 2 different components, one which renders on the server and the other which renders on the client. We can also statically generate the pages using dinoco.

Let us know if you have any questions or feedback. We are happy to help you.
